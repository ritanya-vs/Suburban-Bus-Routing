# **Dynamic Programming-Based Suburban Bus Route Optimization** ðŸšŒ

## About the Project
This project implements a **Dynamic Programming-based algorithm** for optimizing suburban bus routes using **graph theory**. The algorithm determines the **minimum-cost path** while considering various stops and constraints, making it suitable for efficient route planning in urban and suburban areas.

## Key Features:
1. **Dynamic Programming Algorithm**:
   - Utilizes **recursive memoization** to compute the most cost-effective path while handling multiple stops and constraints.  
   - Ensures computational efficiency, even for complex networks.  

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - Models the bus route network as a **graph** using NetworkX, where nodes represent stops and edges denote connections between them.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Visualizes the optimal routes and the entire graph using **NetworkX**, providing a clear and interactive view of the network.

## Tools and Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **NetworkX**: For graph creation, manipulation, and visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting and visualizing results.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Applied for route optimization using memoization techniques.

## Results:
- The algorithm successfully identifies the **minimum-cost path** for given source and destination stops, accounting for all constraints.  
- Visualized routes and graphs demonstrate the efficiency of the model in solving real-world bus route optimization problems.

## Dataset:
The project uses a custom dataset representing suburban bus routes. It includes:
- Nodes: Representing bus stops.
- Edges: Representing connections between stops, with associated costs.
